# groupinator
Tool for creating randomized groups e.g. for classroom assignments

## Setup
Run `npm install` at the root of the project. `npm start` to start the development environment running at localhost:3000.

## Build
May want to replace the `homepage` key in `package.json` depending on hosting path.
